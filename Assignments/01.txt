01  Define Artificial Intelligence (AI) and provide examples of its applications



Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and even interacting with the environment. AI systems are designed to mimic cognitive functions such as learning from experience and adapting to new situations.

Here are some examples of AI applications across various fields:
 
 Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Examples include:
   ->Predictive analytics in finance and marketing.
   ->Personalized recommendations in streaming services like Netflix or Spotify.
   ->Spam detection in email filters.
   ->Image and speech recognition in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.
 Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP involves the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. Examples include:
   ->Chatbots for customer service.
   ->Language translation tools like Google Translate.
   ->Sentiment analysis of social media posts.
   ->Text summarization for news articles.
 Computer Vision: Computer vision enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the real world. Examples include:
   ->Facial recognition for security and authentication.
   ->Autonomous vehicles for navigation and object detection.
   ->Medical image analysis for diagnostics.
   ->Augmented reality applications like Snapchat filters.
 Robotics: Robotics integrates AI with mechanical systems to create autonomous machines capable of performing tasks in various environments. Examples include:
   ->Industrial robots for manufacturing and assembly lines.
   ->Surgical robots for minimally invasive surgeries.
   ->Domestic robots for household chores.
   ->Exploration robots for space or deep-sea exploration.
