10 Explain the purpose of the elif statement in Python.

The elif statement in Python serves as a way to add additional conditions to an if statement. It stands for "else if" and allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially after the initial if condition.

The purpose of the elif statement is to provide a structured and organized way to handle multiple conditional cases within a single control flow structure. Instead of using nested if statements, which can lead to code that is difficult to read and maintain, elif allows you to chain together multiple conditions in a more compact and clear manner.

When the initial if condition evaluates to False, Python checks the subsequent elif conditions in order. If any of these conditions evaluate to True, the corresponding block of code associated with that elif statement is executed. If none of the elif conditions are met, Python continues to the else block (if present) or exits the if statement altogether.

In summary, the elif statement allows you to handle multiple possible outcomes or conditions within an if statement, providing a structured approach to conditional branching in Python code.
